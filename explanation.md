So, the thing is that I have to make an simple way to make tests.

One of my clients wants to only insert the questions and answers for each question. 

The overall design and models relationships looks like this:

But, there are some of the specific things that my client want:

There will be 2 kinds of tests. Academic ones and Leisure ones.

The Leisure ones have to meet certain requirements:  

  * They can create up to 20 questions,
  * All of the questions are simple selection,
  * Nobody can see the code in the browser,
  * They can insert the value of each question,
  * They can insert an image with the result and a brief description of the result,
  * They can program every answer they want for an certain range.
  
The Academic ones have to meet this requirements:

  * They can create up to 30 questions,
  * All of the questions are simple selection,
  * Nobody can see the JS code in the browser,
  * There only will be one correct answer, so every correct answer sums +1 to the total score,
  * People who be correct 70% of the questions pass the test,
  * They can program every answer.
  
If you want to see the overall process, you should see the guides and explanations, but if you only want to download the thing, you can do it by switching to the brand 
**DOWNLOAD** and there you can clone the repo.
 
 The objective will be to create an simple script that you could add to your project and you could program your way to the test and then publish it where you want. May connect
 the questions and answers with a database and that thing.
 
 I'm making this so you do not have to scratch your head thinking all of the stuff.
 
 I will be using POO and Vanilla JS for this.
